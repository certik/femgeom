- export only physical entities - currently everything is exported, but during
  import from tetgen, it will shout if there is some element without a physical
  entity.
- fix the FIXME place in geometry - the whole hole thing. The whole question
  about holes needs to be thought through.
- write a set of rules which the geometry needs to obey and if it does, then
  tetgen will always mesh it without problem. It's in my email box.
- show some progress when calculating element sides (% of the elements done).
  increment every N elements, where N needs to be determined to be let's say
  twice a second on my comp. So for small meshes the progress bar will not slow
  things down.
- play with GID to see how they do it.
