Currently can convert a geometry from a [gmsh](http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/) format to [tetgen](http://tetgen.berlios.de/) and [comsol](http://www.comsol.com/) (former femlab, only partially supported) format and from tetgen back to gmsh, including the regions numbers (=physical entities in gmsh). Also contains reusable 2d polygon partitioning submodule.

**Warning**: this package is in development, it doesn't have any documentation (just comments in the source code) and is only tested on a very few simple examples. But any help or opinions are welcomed.
